Design Document for MERN ProCamShop
1. Introduction

ProCamShop is an e-commerce platform for purchasing cameras and related accessories. It is built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) and aims to provide a seamless shopping experience for users.
2. Architecture Overview

The application is structured around the MERN stack:

    MongoDB: NoSQL database to store product, user, and order information.
    Express.js: Backend framework for creating RESTful APIs and handling server-side logic.
    React.js: Frontend library for building a dynamic user interface.
    Node.js: JavaScript runtime for running the backend server.

3. Components
3.1 Frontend

    React Components: The user interface is built using React components.
        App.js: Main entry point of the React application.
        HomePage.js: Displays featured products and categories.
        ProductPage.js: Detailed view of a single product.
        CartPage.js: User's shopping cart.
        CheckoutPage.js: Handles the checkout process.
        LoginPage.js and RegisterPage.js: User authentication.
        ProfilePage.js: User profile and order history.
    State Management: Uses Redux for managing the application state.
    Routing: React Router for handling client-side routing.
    Styling: CSS or styled-components for styling the application.

3.2 Backend

    Express Server: Handles API requests and serves the frontend.
        server.js: Main entry point for the server.
        routes/productRoutes.js: Routes for product-related operations.
        routes/userRoutes.js: Routes for user authentication and profile management.
        routes/orderRoutes.js: Routes for managing orders.
    Controllers: Logic for handling API requests.
        productController.js: Functions for creating, reading, updating, and deleting products.
        userController.js: Functions for user registration, login, and profile management.
        orderController.js: Functions for creating and managing orders.
    Middleware: Custom middleware for authentication, error handling, and other purposes.
        authMiddleware.js: Protects routes that require authentication.
    Database Models: Mongoose schemas and models.
        User.js: Schema for user data.
        Product.js: Schema for product data.
        Order.js: Schema for order data.

4. Data Flow

    User Registration/Login:
        User registers or logs in through the frontend.
        Credentials are sent to the backend, which verifies them and returns a JWT token.
        The token is stored in the client's local storage or cookies for subsequent requests.

    Product Browsing:
        Users browse products on the frontend.
        The frontend fetches product data from the backend via API requests.
        Product details are displayed dynamically using React components.

    Shopping Cart:
        Users add products to their shopping cart.
        Cart data is managed using Redux and stored in local storage for persistence.

    Checkout and Order Management:
        Users proceed to checkout, where they enter shipping details and payment information.
        The frontend sends the order data to the backend, which processes it and stores it in the database.
        Order confirmation is sent back to the frontend, and the user is redirected to the order summary page.

5. Security Considerations

    Authentication: Uses JWT tokens for user authentication.
    Data Encryption: Sensitive data, such as passwords, are hashed before storing in the database.
    Environment Variables: Secrets (e.g., database URI, JWT secret) are stored in environment variables.
    HTTPS: The application should be served over HTTPS to ensure secure data transmission.

6. Deployment

    Frontend: Can be deployed on platforms like Netlify or Vercel.
    Backend: Can be deployed on platforms like Heroku or DigitalOcean.
    Database: MongoDB Atlas for a managed cloud database service.

7. Conclusion

ProCamShop is a comprehensive e-commerce platform built using the MERN stack, providing a robust and scalable solution for online camera sales. By adhering to best practices in security and deployment, it ensures a secure and efficient shopping experience for users.
